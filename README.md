# Atlas
Atlas is an open-source, cross-platform game manager for Minecraft. The goals of this project are as follows:

* Maintain the basic capability of [Avicore](https://avicus.net/revisions/Avicore) as a game manager.
* Cross-platform design to enable the potential use of multiple server modding API's.
* Through extensive modular and object oriented programming, allow all features of a match to be accessible and modifiable with map configuration files.
* Support multiple formats of map configurations (currently XML).

If successful, Atlas will likely be integrated into the Avicus Network as the primary game manager. It will remain open-source and free to use unless Avicus chooses to head the project in another direction.
